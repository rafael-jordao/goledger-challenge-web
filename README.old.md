# GoLedger Challenge

In this challenge you will create a web interface to a blockchain application. In this application you must implement a race event, car and driver dashboard.

# Requirements

- Your application should be able to add/remove/edit and show all cars, drivers, teams and events;
- Use **React** (all UI libraries are allowed);

## Instructions

- Fork the repository [https://github.com/goledgerdev/goledger-challenge-web](https://github.com/goledgerdev/goledger-challenge-web)
    - Fork it, do **NOT** clone it, since you will need to send us your forked repository
    - If you **cannot** fork it, create a private repository and give access to `samuelvenzi` and `lucas-campelo`.
- Create an web application using React. You will implement the basic operations provided by the API, which are `Create`, `Update`, `Delete` and `Search`.
- Improve your application with a beautiful UI.

## Server

The data are obtained using a rest server at this address: `http://ec2-100-25-136-128.compute-1.amazonaws.com`

Also, a Swagger with the endpoints specifications for the operations is provided at this address: `http://ec2-100-25-136-128.compute-1.amazonaws.com/api-docs/`.

Tip: execute each operation in the Swagger for information on payload format and endpoint addresses.

## Complete the challenge

To complete the challenge, you must send us the link to your forked repository with the code of your application. Please, provide instructions to execute the code.
